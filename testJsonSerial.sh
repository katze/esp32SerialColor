# Demo script for testing the JSON serial transmission
# First, we need to find the serial port
# Then, we need to send a JSON string to the serial port
# Finally, we need to read the response from the serial port
# The response should be a JSON string

# Sample JSON string to send
# {"alcove1": {"colors": ["#ff0000", "#000000"]}, "alcove2": {"colors": ["#ff0000"]}, "alcove3": {"colors": ["#ff0000", "#000000"]}}


# Find the serial port
